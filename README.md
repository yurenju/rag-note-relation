# Note Relation Generator

[English](README.md) | [繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md)

A project designed to help users discover connections between their notes, enabling more efficient organization and exploration of their knowledge base.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main phases:

### 1. Indexing Phase
- Scans and analyzes all note contents
- Creates intelligent indices for subsequent relation searches
- Utilizes RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology to enhance indexing quality

### 2. Search Phase
- Users can provide a note or document as a search basis
- The system analyzes the document content
- Automatically identifies the top 10 most related notes
- Employs LLM (Large Language Model) technology to ensure accuracy and relevance of results

## Core Features

1. **Intelligent Note Indexing**
   - Automatic processing and analysis of note content
   - Creation of high-performance search indices

2. **Related Note Recommendations**
   - Recommends most relevant notes based on input content
   - Displays top 10 most related notes

3. **Flexible Usage**
   - Supports Markdown format notes
   - Developed in TypeScript for maintainability and extensibility

## Use Case

This project primarily assists knowledge workers in building knowledge relation networks by automatically discovering potential connections between notes.

## Expected Benefits

1. **Knowledge Connection Assistant**
   - Helps users discover potential knowledge connections
   - Serves as a knowledge exploration tool
   - Provides initial relation suggestions to inspire deeper thinking

2. **Knowledge Internalization**
   - Guides users to rethink knowledge structure through discovered connections
   - Assists users in building more complete mental knowledge networks
   - Supports users in deepening understanding and reorganizing knowledge

3. **Learning Process Optimization**
   - Lowers the barrier to discovering knowledge connections
   - Guides users to actively think and build knowledge connections
   - Acts as a knowledge integration assistant tool, rather than replacing human thinking
