# Implementation Plan

## Project Development Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure and Document Processing

**Objective**: Establish project infrastructure and implement document reading functionality

**Completion Criteria**:

1. Project Base Setup

   - TypeScript project initialization
   - Establish necessary directory structure:
     - `/tests/data`: Test dataset
     - `/src`: Source code directory
   - Set up basic CLI framework
   - Implement basic error handling

2. Document Processing Implementation
   - Implement recursive reading of all Markdown files from specified directory
   - Implement document chunking functionality
   - Properly handle Chinese text separators (。！？)
   - Complete unit tests

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- ✅ Execute automated tests to verify all functionalities
- ✅ Verify document chunking accuracy using test data
- ✅ Confirm proper Chinese text processing

**Implementation Status (Phase 1 Complete)**:

1. Project Base Setup:

   - ✅ TypeScript project initialized with proper configuration
   - ✅ Directory structure established (`/src`, `/tests/data`)
   - ✅ Basic CLI framework implemented using Commander.js
   - ✅ Basic error handling implemented in both CLI and core functions

2. Document Processing:
   - ✅ Implemented `DocumentProcessor` class with recursive file reading
   - ✅ Integrated LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` for document chunking
   - ✅ Configured proper separators for Chinese text (。！？)
   - ✅ Created comprehensive test suite with mixed language test data

**Next Steps (Phase 2)**:
The next phase will focus on vectorization and database integration. The implementation will continue in a new chat session, building upon the current codebase. Key components to carry forward:

1. The `DocumentProcessor` class will be extended to include vectorization functionality
2. The chunked documents from Phase 1 will serve as input for the vectorization process
3. The CLI framework is ready for adding new commands for database operations

Please refer to Phase 2 section of this document for the next implementation steps.

### Phase 2: Vectorization and Database Integration

**Objective**: Implement document vectorization and data storage functionality

**Completion Criteria**:

1. Vectorization Implementation

   - Integrate jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-zh model
   - Implement text vectorization functionality
   - Ensure stable vectorization process

2. Database Integration
   - Set up LanceDB
   - Implement vector data storage and retrieval
   - Complete database operation error handling
   - Implement database CRUD operations

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- ✅ Verify consistency of vectorization results
- ✅ Validate database operations reliability

**Implementation Status (Phase 2 Complete)**:

1. Vectorization Implementation:

   - ✅ Adopted `@xenova/transformers` with `Xenova/jina-embeddings-v2-base-zh` model for client-side vectorization
   - ✅ Implemented mean pooling and vector normalization
   - ✅ Configured document chunking with size 100 and overlap 20
   - ✅ Maintained consistent vector dimension (768)

2. Database Operations:

   - ✅ Utilized LanceDB for vector storage
   - ✅ Flattened data structure for better reliability:
     - `id`: unique identifier for each chunk
     - `text`: original content
     - `embeddings`: vector representation
     - `source`: file path
     - `from`: starting line number
     - `to`: ending line number
   - ✅ Added database existence check and overwrite protection
   - ✅ Limited initial processing to 20 files for testing

3. Key Features:

   - ✅ Client-side model execution without API dependency
   - ✅ Batch processing for multiple markdown files
   - ✅ Configurable database initialization with `--overwrite` option
   - ✅ Simplified flat schema design for better maintainability

4. Technical Decisions:
   - ✅ Chose Xenova's model for browser compatibility
   - ✅ Flattened metadata structure to avoid Arrow schema complexity
   - ✅ Added file limit for initial testing and development
   - ✅ Removed unused dependencies (@huggingface/inference)

**Objective**: Complete similarity search functionality

**Completion Criteria**:

1. Search Feature Development

   - Implement vector similarity calculation
   - Complete Top-K search functionality
   - Optimize search performance
   - Implement search result ranking

2. User Interface Enhancement
   - Complete CLI interface
   - Implement user-friendly output format
   - Add progress display functionality

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- ✅ Execute performance tests
- ✅ Verify search result accuracy
- User Experience Testing:
  - ✅ Command Intuition Test: Verify command names and parameter design meet user expectations
  - ✅ Output Format Readability: Ensure search results are presented clearly and comprehensibly
  - ✅ Error Message Friendliness: Verify clear error messages and correction suggestions when users make mistakes
  - ✅ Progress Feedback Timeliness: Ensure real-time progress display during long-running operations
  - ✅ Documentation Completeness: Verify help command provides sufficient usage instructions

**Implementation Status (Phase 3 Complete)**:

1. Search Feature Implementation:

   - ✅ Integrated LanceDB's vector similarity search with cosine distance
   - ✅ Implemented Top-K search with configurable limit
   - ✅ Utilized IVF_PQ index for optimized search performance
   - ✅ Added result ranking based on cosine similarity scores

2. User Interface:

   - ✅ Enhanced CLI with intuitive command structure
   - ✅ Designed user-friendly output format with:
     - Emoji indicators for better visual scanning
     - Percentage-based similarity scores
     - Clear source file and line number references
   - ✅ Added progress indicators for long-running operations

3. Key Features:

   - ✅ Fast and accurate semantic search using pre-built vector index
   - ✅ Support for searching by file content or file path
